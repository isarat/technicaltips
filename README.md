For years I blogged several technical tips under the blog codereflect.com which doesn't exist today. One single fine day, I decided not to blog anymore technical tips.

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is undisputed place to get answer for most of your technical questions. This is an effort not to replace Stackoverflow but to collect my whole effort as an archive and make it searchable via github pages.
